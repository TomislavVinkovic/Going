## **üöÄ Setup and Installation**

To run this project on your own machine, you will need to set up your own Firebase project and obtain a Google Maps API key.

### **Prerequisites**

* Android Studio (latest version recommended)  
* A Google account for Firebase and Google Cloud Console.

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

git clone \[https://github.com/your-username/going-app.git\](https://github.com/your-username/going-app.git)  
cd going-app

### **Step 2: Create and Configure Your Firebase Project**

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.  
2. Add an Android app to your project.  
   * **Package Name:** Make sure the package name matches the applicationId in the app/build.gradle.kts file (e.g., com.example.going).  
   * Follow the instructions to download the google-services.json file.  
3. Place the downloaded **google-services.json** file into the **app/** directory of your Android Studio project.  
4. **Enable Authentication:**  
   * In the Firebase Console, go to **Build \> Authentication**.  
   * Click the "Sign-in method" tab.  
   * Enable the **Email/Password** provider.  
   * Enable the **Google** provider. Provide a project support email when prompted.  
5. **Set Up Cloud Firestore:**  
   * Go to **Build \> Cloud Firestore**.  
   * Click "Create database" and start in **Production mode**.  
   * Choose a location for your database (e.g., europe-west).  
   * Go to the **Rules** tab and paste the following rules to allow users to read events and manage their own data:
   ```
     rules\_version \= '2';  
     service cloud.firestore {  
       match /databases/{database}/documents {  
         match /users/{userId} {  
           allow list, create: if true;  
           allow read, update, delete: if request.auth \!= null && request.auth.uid \== userId;  
         }  
         match /events/{eventId} {  
           allow read: if request.auth \!= null;  
         }  
         match /eventInterests/{interestId} {  
             allow read, create, delete: if request.auth \!= null;  
         }  
       }  
     }
   ```

   * You will need to manually create an **events** collection in the Firestore Data tab and add a few sample documents for the app to display something.

### **Step 3: Get Your Google Maps API Key**

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Make sure you have the same project selected as your Firebase project.  
2. In the navigation menu, go to **APIs & Services \> Library**.  
3. Search for and enable the **Maps SDK for Android**.  
4. Go to **APIs & Services \> Credentials**.  
5. Click **\+ CREATE CREDENTIALS \> API key**.  
6. Copy the generated API key.  
7. Open the app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml file in Android Studio and replace the placeholder with your key:
   ```
   <meta-data  
       android:name="com.google.android.geo.API\_KEY"  
       android:value="YOUR\_API\_KEY\_HERE" /\>
   ```

### **Step 4: Build and Run the App**

You should now be able to build and run the project in Android Studio.

## **üîÆ Future Improvements**

This project is under active development. Here are some of the features planned for the future:

* **Friends List & Activity Feed:** Fully implement the social features, including adding/removing friends, viewing their profiles, and seeing which events they are interested in.  
* **Implement Repository Pattern:** Refactor the data layer to use the Repository pattern to abstract data sources, which will make testing easier and allow for future offline caching capabilities.  
* **Custom Backend:** Migrate from a pure Firebase backend to a custom Laravel backend  for more complex business logic and API control that is not easily achievable with Firestore.  
* **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Enhance the search functionality with more powerful filters, including:  
  * Filtering events by a specific date range.  
  * Searching for events within a certain radius (e.g., 5km, 10km) of the user.  
  * Filtering by event tags.
